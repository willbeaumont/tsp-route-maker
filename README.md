# tsp-route-maker
## Overview
Project to create an interface for users to input addresses and receive optimal routing for deliveries. Some charitable organizations manually calculate delivery routes for services provided to the community. We are looking to provide a low-cost/free service to help with routing. These services can deliver 50-100 meals a day to elderly and homebound people.

## User Stories
* Enter/upload addresses into webform
* Select number of available drivers and capacity
* Receive optimal routing to deliver day's meals
* Reward routes that are kept week to week (meal recipients like to have consistent delivery drivers)
